# autograd-helpers
## By [Peter Sharpe](https://peterdsharpe.github.io)


Just a collections of functions that I've written to make my life more harmonious when working with the [Autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd) package!

I would submit this as a pull request to autograd directly, but to be honest, I haven't really tested, profiled, or optimized this code very much, so I don't want to fully release it "into the wild" just yet.
